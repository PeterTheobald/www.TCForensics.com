description: My client, the wife in a divorce, knew her husband had some Bitcoins but not how many. The husband admitted to having $40,000 worth of Bitcoins that he purchased about a year ago. Both parties wanted the value to remain in Bitcoin and the husband agreed to transfer half the coins to his wife. I assisted my client in setting up a secure Bitcoin wallet to receive the transferred coins.<br><br>After the husband transferred approximately $20,000 worth of Bitcoins to my client I verified the transfer, then I took a closer look at the source of the Bitcoins. I examined the transaction in the public Bitcoin blockchain ledger and followed the transfer to its source. I found $40,000 in Bitcoins had been transferred to that address the previous day from an address holding $200,000 in Bitcoins. Following one more step back I saw the $200,000 in bitcoins had been transferred or purchased a little over a year ago when it had been worth approximately $40,000. My clientâ€™s attorney was able to negotiate a sharing of this larger amount as part of the settlement.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties' privacy
