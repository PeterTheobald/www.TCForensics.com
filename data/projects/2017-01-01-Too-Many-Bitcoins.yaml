description: My client, the wife in a divorce, knew her husband had some Bitcoins but not how many. The husband admitted to having approximately $40,000 worth of Bitcoins. Both parties wanted the value to remain in Bitcoin and the husband agreed to transfer half the coins to his wife. I assisted my client in setting up a secure Bitcoin wallet to receive the transferred coins. <br><br> After the husband transferred approximately $20,000 worth of Bitcoins to my client I was asked to investigate the source of the Bitcoins more closely. I examined the transaction in the public Bitcoin blockchain ledger and located the source of the bitcoins only to find that the $40,000 worth of Bitcoins had just been transferred to that previous address the evening the husband has admitted to having the coins. Following the source of that transaction one step further back I found another transaction the same evening with approximately $180,000 worth of Bitcoins being split into two separate addresses having $40,000 and $140,000 each. My client's attorney was able to negotiate a sharing of this larger amount as part of the settlement.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties privacy
