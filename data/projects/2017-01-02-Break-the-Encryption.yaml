description: In this partner dispute I was presented with a hard drive with financial records encrypted with TrueCrypt. Each litigant blamed the other. One litigant claimed the other guessed his encryption key and changed it so he could no longer decrypt it. The other litigant claimed this was a lie and his ex-partner didn’t want to reveal the financial records on the hard drive. The attorney on the case told me he had spoken with “an ex-FBI guy” who said to forget it - TrueCrypt is unbreakable. Was there anything I could do? <br><br>I told him that is is true that I knew of no known flaws in TrueCrypt’s implementation. There were a few things I could try and let run for several weeks but there were no guarantees - It could take millions of years to crack TrueCrypt with a brute-force search for the key. I was given two weeks to see what I could do. <br><br>I set up three cracking stations. The first would run a brute force search across every possible password. This method could eventually find any password, but could take millions of years to finish searching. For the second cracking station I scanned the litigants hard drive and built a dictionary of every word in every document, file, email, and web page on the entire hard drive. The second station tried every word and various permutations of this custom built dictionary.<br><br>For the third cracking station I downloaded the biggest password lists I could find. These included huge dictionaries, word lists from every piece of literature at Project Gutenberg and millions of passwords taken from Internet hacks and breaches over the years. <br><br>Every day I would work with those three monitors behind me endlessly scrolling password guesses down the screen like a scene from The Matrix. At the end of two weeks I had to call the attorney and tell him, ‘Sorry - the TrueCrypt cracking has been running all this time with no luck.’ He said a court date had been rescheduled and to let it run for another week. One day I came in and one of the stations had stopped scrolling. For a moment I thought the software had crashed and all that time was lost, until I realized that in the most anticlimactic success output ever there was a single word displayed on the screen followed by a prompt for my next command. <br><br>The password had been a long string of meaningless letters and numbers found in the download of cracked website passwords that the user must have used for an online account that had been breached.  The brute force would never have found it in my lifetime. I picked up the phone to deliver the good news!<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties' privacy
