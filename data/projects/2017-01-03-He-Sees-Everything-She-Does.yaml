description: During the course of her divorce, our client suspected that her husband was using spyware to monitor her activities. TC Forensics was brought in to copy her home and work computers in order to investigate for the presence of spyware or surveillance software. I discovered 'Spector Pro' surveillance software running on her office computer. I traced it to an email he had sent her months earlier which included an attachment claiming to be a photo, but which in fact was the installer for the spyware. The spyware captured everything she typed and everything she looked at. It sent the spy reports to the husbands email account, which was his full name @gmail.com . I documented everything that implicated the husband in this. The wife works at a law firm and the husband had been capturing all of her privileged case work. The law firm is considering criminal charges against the husband.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties' privacy
