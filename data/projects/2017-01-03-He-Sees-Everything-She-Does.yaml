description: The husband in this divorce always seemed to know things that were private between the wife and her attorney. I was retained to search the wife's personal and office computers for surveillance software. I found nothing on the personal computer, but I found Spector Pro surveillance software running on her office computer. I traced it to an email he had sent her months earlier titled 'Look at this great picture of the kids playing soccer' - but the attachment wasn't a photo it was the spyware covert installation program. She clicked on the attachment, saw an blank photo and thought it was just a computer glitch. The spyware captured everything she typed and everything she looked at. It sent the spy reports to the husbands email account, which was his full name @gmail.com . I documented everything that implicated the husband in this. To make matters worse the wife works at a law firm and the husband had been capturing all of her privileged case work. The law firm was considering criminal charges against the husband.
