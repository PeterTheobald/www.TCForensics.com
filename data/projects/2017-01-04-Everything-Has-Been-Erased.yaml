description: In this matrimonial dispute the wife accused the husband of hiding profits from his auto parts warehouse by directing sales through pseudonymous eBay accounts. I arrived at his auto parts warehouse with an ex-parte order to preserve the owner's computer hard drives. He had me wait outside while I could hear him yelling at his attorney on the phone. After a very long wait he let me in and I copied his desktop and laptop hard drives. On examination I found an blank newly formatted operating system. The format date and time showed me it had been formatted during the time I waited outside the auto parts warehouse. Fortunately a reformat only marks the drive 'free and available' and hardly erases anything. I was able to recover a great deal of eBay transaction records related to the allegations.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect privacy
