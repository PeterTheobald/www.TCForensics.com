description: "I was retained to recover contracts, customer lists and documents for the receivers of a business in bankruptcy who were attempting to recover some of the value in the existing contracts. There were allegations that the original owners were trying to sell the customers on the side. The original owners denied these allegations. They claimed a document server containing contracts had suffered a hard drive loss when the cleaning crew plugged a vacuum cleaner into the same outlet and blew the circuit. When I examined the server I found the hard drive was completely erased with the exception of the signature text of the tool HDDErase ‘THIS DRIVE: SERIAL NUMBER xxxx WAS SUCCESSFULLY ERASED ON MON SEP 05 00:42:05 2017’. The attorneys were notified that the loss of the contracts was no accident.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties' privacy"
