description: I was retained to recover contracts, customer lists and documents for the receivers of a business in bankruptcy who were attempting to recover some of the value in the existing contracts. There were allegations that the original owners were trying to sell the customers on the side. The original owners denied these allegations. They claimed a document server containing contracts had suffered a hard drive loss when the evening cleaning crew plugged a vacuum cleaner into the same outlet and blew the circuit. When I examined the server I found the hard drive was completely erased with the exception of the text 'THIS DRIVE SUCCESSFULLY ERASED AT...' followed by the identification of an open source disk wipe utility and the date and time the drive had been wiped.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties privacy
