description: This divorcing father faced losing custody and visitation rights to his children. His wife claimed he was a danger to the children and as evidence her computer expert had produced a report containing pages of pornography from web sites visited on his computer. The most damning page showed a photo of a nude adult actress and next to it a photo of a young girl on a beach. The expert had not included any context or meta-data about the photos. The judge and the child's law guardian had both expressed concern over these photos. The father admitted to occasionally viewing legal adult pornography but had no idea who the young girl in the photo was. I was retained to examine the hard drive, find some context for the photos and help prepare the cross-examination. I found that the adult actress was viewed on a web site on one day and the young girl on the beach was from a tourism web site viewed a completely different day. There was no connection between the two photos besides the wife's expert's choice to present them together. On cross-examination he testified that the order of photos was random and he knew of no connection between the photos. The judge agreed that the report was misleading and prejudicial and had it removed from evidence.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect privacy
