description: I was hired to attempt a recovery of a court stenographer’s machine that was destroyed in a fire immediately after taking the transcript of a deposition. I received a large box with the burnt and melted remains of the machine. I got airplane shears used for cutting metal and started clearing away pieces. When I recognized USB ports I knew I had found the rear panel. I cut away the rear panel and found an intact SD memory card that had been inserted into the machine. After cleaning it up with alcohol I inserted it into a reader and was able to open it and see stenography PTF files. I quickly copied the files out and sent them to the stenographer who was able to get the transcript out on time.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties' privacy
