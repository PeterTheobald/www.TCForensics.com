              <p>My client, the wife in a divorce, knew her husband had some Bitcoins but not how many. The husband admitted to having $40,000 worth of Bitcoins that he purchased about a year ago. Both parties wanted the value to remain in Bitcoin and the husband agreed to transfer half the coins to his wife. I assisted my client in setting up a secure Bitcoin wallet to receive the transferred coins.<br><br>After the husband transferred approximately $20,000 worth of Bitcoins to my client I verified the transfer, then I took a closer look at the source of the Bitcoins. I examined the transaction in the public Bitcoin blockchain ledger and followed the transfer to its source. I found $40,000 in Bitcoins had been transferred to that address the previous day from an address holding $200,000 in Bitcoins. Following one more step back I saw the $200,000 in bitcoins had been transferred or purchased a little over a year ago when it had been worth approximately $40,000. My client’s attorney was able to negotiate a sharing of this larger amount as part of the settlement.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties&rsquo; privacy</p>

              <h2>Break the Encryption</h2>
              <p class="item-intro text-muted">Could a hard drive encrypted with TrueCrypt be opened? (tl;dr Yes!)</p>
              
              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="http://test.TCForensics.com/img/portfolio/matrix-400.jpg" alt="">
              <p>In this partner dispute I was presented with a hard drive with financial records encrypted with TrueCrypt. Each litigant blamed the other. One litigant claimed the other guessed his encryption key and changed it so he could no longer decrypt it. The other litigant claimed this was a lie and his ex-partner didn’t want to reveal the financial records on the hard drive. The attorney on the case told me he had spoken with “an ex-FBI guy” who said to forget it - TrueCrypt is unbreakable. Was there anything I could do? <br><br>I told him that is is true that I knew of no known flaws in TrueCrypt’s implementation. There were a few things I could try and let run for several weeks but there were no guarantees - It could take millions of years to crack TrueCrypt with a brute-force search for the key. I was given two weeks to see what I could do. <br><br>I set up three cracking stations. The first would run a brute force search across every possible password. This method could eventually find any password, but could take millions of years to finish searching. For the second cracking station I scanned the litigants hard drive and built a dictionary of every word in every document, file, email, and web page on the entire hard drive. The second station tried every word and various permutations of this custom built dictionary.<br><br>For the third cracking station I downloaded the biggest password lists I could find. These included huge dictionaries, word lists from every piece of literature at Project Gutenberg and millions of passwords taken from Internet hacks and breaches over the years. <br><br>Every day I would work with those three monitors behind me endlessly scrolling password guesses down the screen like a scene from The Matrix. At the end of two weeks I had to call the attorney and tell him, ‘Sorry - the TrueCrypt cracking has been running all this time with no luck.’ He said a court date had been rescheduled and to let it run for another week. One day I came in and one of the stations had stopped scrolling. For a moment I thought the software had crashed and all that time was lost, until I realized that in the most anticlimactic success output ever there was a single word displayed on the screen followed by a prompt for my next command. <br><br>The password had been a long string of meaningless letters and numbers found in the download of cracked website passwords that the user must have used for an online account that had been breached.  The brute force would never have found it in my lifetime. I picked up the phone to deliver the good news!<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties&rsquo; privacy</p>

              <p>During the course of her divorce, our client suspected that her husband was using spyware to monitor her activities. TC Forensics was brought in to copy her home and work computers in order to investigate for the presence of spyware or surveillance software. I discovered &lsquo;Spector Pro&rsquo; surveillance software running on her office computer. I traced it to an email he had sent her months earlier which included an attachment claiming to be a photo, but which in fact was the installer for the spyware. The spyware captured everything she typed and everything she looked at. It sent the spy reports to the husbands email account, which was his full name @gmail.com . I documented everything that implicated the husband in this. The wife works at a law firm and the husband had been capturing all of her privileged case work. The law firm is considering criminal charges against the husband.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties&rsquo; privacy</p>

              <p>In this matrimonial dispute the wife accused the husband of hiding profits from his auto parts warehouse by directing sales through pseudonymous eBay accounts. I arrived at his auto parts warehouse with an ex-parte order to preserve the owner’s computer hard drives. He had me wait outside while I could hear him yelling at his attorney on the phone. After a very long wait he let me in and I copied his desktop and laptop hard drives. On examination I found a blank newly formatted operating system. The format date and time showed me it had been formatted during the time I waited outside the auto parts warehouse. Fortunately a reformat only marks the drive ‘free and available’ and hardly erases anything. I was able to recover a great deal of eBay transaction records related to the allegations.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties&rsquo; privacy</p>

The staff member followed the caller’s instructions and set up remote access to the medical office’s computer. After over 30 minutes the staff member thought to notify the doctor who, alarmed, had her pull the plug immediately. I was brought in to examine the hard drive and determine if any patient data had been accessed or downloaded and to help determine if there was a duty to report the incident. I made a timeline of every file and document accessed and carefully examined every file touched from the moment the remote person gained access. I found that he had installed more remote access back-doors but at no time had he touched any files with patient data before the plug was pulled.

              <p>In a divorce proceeding involving a custody dispute, the wife&rsquo;s computer expert produced a report containing photos of pornography from web sites visited on the husband&rsquo;s computer alongside a picture of young girl found on the computer. The expert had not included any context or meta-data about the photos. This report was shown to the psychiatric expert who recommended that our client only have supervised visitation. The psychiatric expert stated that the opposing computer expert’s report was influential in coming to his recommendations. The father admitted to occasionally viewing legal adult pornography but had no idea who the young girl in the photo was. I was retained to examine the hard drive, find some context for the photos and help prepare the cross-examination. I found that the adult actress was viewed on a web site on one day and the young girl on the beach was from a tourism web site viewed a completely different day. There was no connection between the two photos besides the wife’s expert’s choice to present them together. On cross-examination he testified that the order of photos was random and he knew of no connection between the photos. The court agreed that the report was misleading and prejudicial and had both the opposing computer expert’s report and the psychiatric report removed from consideration.<br><br>*Note details have been changed to protect the parties&rsquo; privacy</p>
